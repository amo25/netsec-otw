of course! grep can just take multiple files for searching haha. Got so stuck on the idea that you can only one file can be the object of the search

passthru executes a command
it's calling grep on a file called dictionary.txt on the server
grep -i $key dictionary.txt
-i ignores case
try to execute a command within a command?
like "cat /etc/natas_pass/natas9" or something?
exploit passthru directly?
passing it "*" made it spit out the sourcecode... did it crash? or is this the beginnning of an exploit?

use -f file option somehow?
Use verbosity (e.g. explicitly say password does not match...)
